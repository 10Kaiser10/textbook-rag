SOUND_SUMMARY = """
Short Summary:
The document is a comprehensive chapter on sound from a science textbook, explaining the basic principles of sound production, propagation, and characteristics. 
It covers topics such as mechanical and longitudinal waves, frequency, amplitude, pitch, and the speed of sound in various media. 
Key concepts like reflection of sound, echoes, reverberation, and the human auditory range are explored. 
The text also discusses practical applications of sound, including ultrasound in medical imaging and sonar technology. 
Exercises and examples help reinforce the understanding of sound waves and their properties.
